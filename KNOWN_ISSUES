KNOWN ISSUES

Some color mapping errors are happening with textured shapes in 16 bit
mode.  Use double-buffering and "blit_flip" to overcome this.  In fact,
there really is not a good reason to not use double-buffering for 16
bit mode anyway.

blit_transform - flip_horizontal - has known issues.  Try instead rotating
180 degrees and then flip_vertical.

Some framebuffer drivers are tearfully slow.  I have noticed that the
Nouveau framebuffer driver for NVidia is Molasses slow.  Perhaps it's
because it is mirroring the same display on three 4K monitors (I'd
rather it not, but it does).  Regardless, it's amazing how slow it is.
Other framebuffer drivers are amazingly fast.  It's clear the Nouveau
framebuffer driver is in dire need of optimization, or at the very
least hardware accelerated buffer copy.  I'll be looking into finding
ways to overcome this issue.  Maybe turning off the mirroring would
help.
