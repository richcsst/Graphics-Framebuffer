TO DO

The following are some ideas for the future:

==============================================================================

* Use DRM Framebuffer Compatibility Mode

DRM drivers (those without a "/dev/fb0" file) have a framebuffer compatibility
capability I may exploit to allow all video cards to work with this module.

However, this won't guarantee hardware acceleration, but it will be a step in
that direction.

==============================================================================

* Polygons With Rounded Corners *

Polygons with rounded corners would be difficult, but doable.  It has become
quite difficult to get working so far.  I haven't given up.

==============================================================================

* Completely accelerate all primitive drawing

Currently only some functions are C code accelerated.  More are added as work
progresses.

The slowest will be addressed first.

==============================================================================

* Incorporate all methods that need Imager to use their own C code, so Imager
  is no longer needed.

Imager's lack of support for RGB565 is the reason for this need.  The slight
increase in speed won't hurt either.

==============================================================================

* Add single bit monochrome drawing

Having the appropriate hardware for this would make it a lot easier, which I
do not have.  So right now this would be lucky guesses.  Want to donate or
loan one?

==============================================================================

* Add 8 bit palletized drawing.

Not sure about this, as not much of anything uses it now days.
