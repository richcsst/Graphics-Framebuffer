TO DO

The following are some ideas for the future:

* Polygons With Rounded Corners *

Polygons with rounded corners would be difficult, but doable.  It has become
quite difficult to get working so far.  I haven't given up.

* Completely accelerate all primitive drawing

Currently only some functions are C code accelerated.

The slowest will be addressed first.

* Incorporate all methods that need Imager to use their own C code, so Imager
* is no longer needed.

Imager's lack of support for RGB565 is the reason for this need.  The slight
increase in speed won't hurt either.

* Make double-buffering the default for 16 bit and make it seamless. *

It's close right now

############# MAYBEs - BIG MAYBEs below ################

Access the DRM mode framebuffer for those drivers without native FBDEV
support.   If I succeed with this, then MAYBE I can also incorporate some GPU
accelerated methods.

For this module's intended design philosophy, accessing the DRM may be too
much overhead.  If GPU acceleration methods deviate too much from this
module's intended design, then that doesn't mean a "Graphics::DRM" won't be
possible.  Just don't get your hopes up right now.
