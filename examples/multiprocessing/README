Multiprocessing Examples
Just use "perldoc" for each file to read its documentation
==============================================================================

* get_mce-demos         - A library with a more efficient alternative for
                          multiprocessing (multitasking) your scripts.  This
                          will download the example scripts.  See "README.MCE"
                          for more details.

* threaded_primitives   - Just like "primitives.pl" in the prvious directory,
                          but it draws with multiple threads and runs much
                          faster if you have an efficient framebuffer driver.

* threaded_slideshow.pl - Shows multiple images at a time from a specific
                          directory.  It will show as many images at a time as
                          there are cores in your CPU.

* threaded_template     - A coding skeleton for drawing with threads.  Copy
                          and use the copy, never the original file.
