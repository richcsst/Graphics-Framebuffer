DETERMINING IF YOUR SYSTEM HAS A FRAMEBUFFER FIRST

  You need to make sure your system has a Framebuffer driver installed.  The
  easiest way to find this out, is to look in the "/dev" directory and see if
  there are files in there called "fb" and end with a number between 0 and 31.
  Most systems have "/dev/fb0", but there can be more.

  If such a file exists, then you have a framebuffer.

  If no such file exists, then you need to either learn how to enable it, or
  as a last resort, you can use the VESA video drivers that are minimalist
  framebuffer devices.  This usually involves editing the grub configuration
  files and passing the video type to the kernel command line.  This is
  typically the "vga" variable.

  ** Mario Roy has an excellent tutorial on enabling the Framebuffer on a
     CentOS system.  This may be helpful on other distributions as well:

     *  https://github.com/marioroy/mce-examples/tree/master/framebuffer

MAKE SURE YOUR USER ACCOUNT HAS ACCESS TO THE VIDEO DEVICE

  *  sudo usermod -a -G video username

     Change "username" with the username of your account

DETERMINE YOUR DISTRIBUTION

  There are various distributions of operating systems this module should work
  on.  Those are POSIX or Unix like systems that map devices to the file
  system.  This includes, but is not limited to Unix, Linux, and BSD.

  The two I will concentrate on in this document are Debian and RedHat based
  linux distributions.

  Debian distributions use "apt" utility to manage packages.  Debian
  distributions are typically:

    *  Debian
    *  Ubuntu
    *  Kubuntu
    *  Xunbuntu
    *  Mint
    *  Raspian

  RedHat distributions use the "yum" utility to manage packages.  RedHat
  distributions are typically:

    *  RedHat
    *  Fedora
    *  CentOS
    *  ClearOS
    *  Scientific Linux
    *  SME
    *  Aurora
    *  Berry
    *  Yellow Dog

  I have added two shell scripts to make installation of this module very easy.

  For Debian based systems:

    *  installing/install-prerequisites-debian.sh

  For RedHat based systems:

    *  installing/install-prerequesites-redhat.sh

  I have also included a script to detect the type of distribution you have.
  It's not 100% accurate, but usually works:

    *  detect.sh

  If you still are not sure, you can go to the following URL and your
  distribution should be there, with the type of core base it is:

    *  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions

  Pick the appropriate prerequisie script to run.

  It will install the absolute minimum packages on your system needed to use
  this module.

  Next it will ask you if you are using the packaged version of Perl, the one
  included in your distribution.  If you are, then you need to answer "yes"
  to the question and allow it to install the Perl prerequisites.

INSTALLING WITH PACKAGED PERL

  Acquiring (use only one method):
  
    *  Use CPAN, run:  install Graphics::Framebuffer
    *  git https://github.com/richcsst/Graphics-Framebuffer.git

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       [sudo] make install

INSTALLING WITH PERLBREW (and installing Perlbrew)

  If you do not want to use the package version of Perl, but would rather use
  a customized and more optimized version of Perl, then do the following:

    *  wget -O - https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

  Append the following line to your " ~/.bash_profile " then log out and log in
  again:

    *  source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc

  Now to install Perlbrew (you can use higher version numbers where applicable):
  
    *  perlbrew install -n perl-5.30.1 -Dusethreads
    *  perlbrew clean
    *  perlbrew switch perl-5.30.1
    *  perlbrew install-cpanm
    *  cpanm -n Inline::C Math::Bezier Math::Gradient File::Map Imager
    *  cpanm -n MCE::Shared Sereal::Encoder Sereal::Decoder Sys::CPU
    *  cpanm -n Graphics::Framebuffer
