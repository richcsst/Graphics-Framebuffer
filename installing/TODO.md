TO DO

The following are some ideas for the future:

* Requests are seriously considered for new features or system compatibility.

Many features this module have were as a result of user requests.

==============================================================================

* Completely C accelerate all primitive drawing

Currently only some functions are C code accelerated.  More are added as work
progresses.

The slowest will be addressed first.

Realistically though, I doubt some specific routines will be converted, as
they would be determined to be sufficiently quick.

==============================================================================

* Incorporate all methods that need Imager to use their own C code, so Imager
  is no longer needed.

Imager's lack of support for RGB565 (16 bit) is the reason for this need.  The
slight increase in speed won't hurt either.

==============================================================================
